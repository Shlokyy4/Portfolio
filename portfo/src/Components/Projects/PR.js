    { title: "SafeBites - A Smart Ingredient Scanner and Health Advisor", description: "Developed SafeBite, a mobile app that scans food labels using OCR and ML to detect allergens and harmful ingredients. It cross-checks against international food safety standards (FDA, FSSAI, EFSA) and provides real-time health alerts. Built with React Native (frontend) and Flask-Python (backend). Achieved over 90% accuracy in ingredient detection across varied label formats." },
    { title: "Automatic Grass Cutter Robot using Arduino", description: "Designed and developed an autonomous grass-cutting robot using Arduino Uno and ultrasonic sensors. The system detects obstacles and adjusts its path dynamically to perform efficient grass cutting. Integrated DC motors for movement and a BLDC motor for blade rotation, powered by a 12V Li-ion battery. Implemented servo-based sensor scanning for wider detection range. Ensured energy-efficient operation and safety features. The project aimed to reduce manual effort in lawn maintenance and explore future integration with solar power and IoT-based monitoring." },
    { title: "AR_VR Walkthrough", description: "Worked on an AR/VR project titled 'AR/VR Walkthrough' as part of an internship at SIES Graduate School of Technology. Developed an immersive virtual walkthrough of the college floor, showcasing classrooms, doors, and facilities. Gained hands-on experience in augmented and virtual reality technologies, 3D modeling, and interactive environment creation." }
